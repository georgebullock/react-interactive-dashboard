# REACT INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD

This project is still in the planning phase. For now, this repo is a scaffold for the project. The README.md will be updated as I make progress towards completing the project. 

### OVERVIEW

React Interactive Dashboard is a commenting application. The app will support two user types: admin users and non-admin users. The only feature for non-admin users is making comments (which post to a main thread) and deleting their own comments. Admin users will be able to make comments, delete their own (and other users) comments, and access an admin dashboard where they can view comment analytics.
